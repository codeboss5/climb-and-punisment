An absolute classic. Crimpy crux with a straight forward top out. Start left on the Main Wall, climb up through jugs, traverse through two side pulls into the throne room (crux), sort out your feet and top out to the right. Central cavity out of bounds, as is anything on the top until you pass the throne room.
