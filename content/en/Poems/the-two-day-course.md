There's a blight upon the country that is really quite degrading,

Invented by the bureaucrats to keep their jobs from fading.

A nasty imposition that has now been put in force,

It's become an obligation to attend a two-day course.

There are courses by the hundred to improve your education,

It's now become essential that you get accreditation.

You will need that piece of paper or you'll really be in strife,

Although what you'll be learning you've been learning all your life.

In the drought of 69, I cut scrub from dawn to dark,

And fence posts by the thousand I have hewn from iron bark.

Now, it's hard for me to fathom that I could break the law,

If I dared to start the motor of my trusty old chainsaw.

Take chemical applications, that's something I know best,

By now I must have sprayed every single living pest,

From cattle ticks to Buffalo fly, from burrs to rubber vine,

Now, a course must be attended or I'll cop a whopping fine.

Just ask those who know me if I know how to use a gun!

From every sort of weapon, I've shot bullets by the ton.

Though I have been proficient since I reached the age of ten,

It seems that this is something that I have to learn again.

I've studied on computers, learned how to market crops,

Benchmarking and Q. A.- - I've been to those workshops.

Breed plan is something I now understand in full,

It took 2 days to learn to tell cows from a bull.

My stock are getting poorer from the general lack of care,

And all my gates and fences are in sad need of repair.

You might think me lazy, but that simply isn't true,

I'd go to work tomorrow, but there's another course to do.

The bank would like to see me for the funds are getting low,

And I'd like to take the time to plant the crops I need to grow.

My wife and kids all miss me 'cause I'm hardly ever there,

I'd love to stay at home, but there's this course in cattle care.

If I continue in this vein, I'll surely end up broke,

All these accreditations are really just a joke.

I'd rather wrestle while scrub bulls or ride a wild bush horse,

Then find myself subjected to just one more two-day course.
