Some years ago, Sherlock Holmes and his loyal friend and student Watson, were together on a camping trip. After a good meal, they lay down for the night and went to sleep. Some hours later. Holmes awoke and nudged his faithful friend awake. "Watson," he said, "look up at the sky and tell me what you see.

"I see millions and millions of stars," Watson replied. "What does that tell you?" Holmes questioned. Watson pondered the question and then said, "Astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo. Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three. Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful and that we are small and insignificant Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. What does it tell you?" 

"Watson, you idiot!" said Holmes with a measure of restraint "Someone has stolen our tent!"
