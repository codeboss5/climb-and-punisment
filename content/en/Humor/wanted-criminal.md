One time when I was like six I was in Walmart and I was eating a tube of Pringles and I ate them while my mom paid but I forgot to let the guy scan my Pringles so I walked to the door and an alarm went off and I just started running because I got scared and then my mom couldn't find me because I was hiding behind the newspaper things and the Walmart people called the police because I was missing and when I heard them show up I thought I was a criminal so I left my mom a note on the newspaper that said I went to Mexico to start a new life and not to come looking for me and then I took off running with my Pringles can and I ran for like an hour and then the cops saw me walking down the road so they pulled over so I started running again and then they were using the like car intercom thing and they told me to stop running so when I did I thought they were going to put me in handcuffs and take me to jail so I was crying and I slapped the officer in the stomach and tried to run again but he just held me back and when he asked me what happened to me and I told him he started crying he was laughing so hard. And he just gave my mom two dollars for the Pringles and he was still laughing when he left. And that's the time I was a wanted criminal.
