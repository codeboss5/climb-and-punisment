The one-time heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali was not exactly famous for his humility; he only ever referred to himself as The Greatest. He was flying to one of his engagements and during the flight the aircraft ran into foul weather. Turbulence began to toss the plane about, the passengers were instructed to fasten their seatbelts immediately, and all complied but Ali. 

The flight attendant approached him and requested that he observe the Captain's order. Ali audaciously responded, "Superman don't need no seatbelt. The flight attendant did not miss a beat, but quickly fired in reply, "Superman don't need no airplane either!"
