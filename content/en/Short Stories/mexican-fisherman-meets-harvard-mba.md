What Really Matters in Life?

A vacationing American businessman standing on the pier of a quaint coastal fishing village in southern Mexico watched as a small boat with just one young Mexican fisherman pulled into the dock. Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. Enjoying the warmth of the early afternoon sun, the American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish. "How long did it take you to catch them?" the American casually asked. "Oh, a few hours," the Mexican fisherman replied. "Why don't you stay out longer and catch more fish?" the American businessman then asked. The Mexican warmly replied, "With this I have more than enough to meet my family's needs." The businessman then became serious, "But what do you do with the rest of your time?" Responding with a smile, the Mexican fisherman answered, "I sleep late, play with my children, watch ball games, and take siesta with my wife. Sometimes in the evenings I take a stroll into the village to see my friends, play the guitar, sing a few songs..." The American businessman impatiently interrupted, "Look, I have an MBA from Harvard, and I can help you to be more profitable. You can start by fishing several hours longer every day. You can then sell the extra fish you catch. With the extra money, you can buy a bigger boat. With the additional income that larger boat will bring, before long you can buy a second boat, then a third one, and so on, until you have an entire fleet of fishing boats." Proud of his own sharp thinking, he excitedly elaborated a grand scheme which could bring even bigger profits, "Then, instead of selling your catch to a middleman you'll be able to sell your fish directly to the processor, or even open your own cannery. Eventually, you could control the product, processing and distribution. You could leave this tiny coastal village and move to Mexico City, or possibly even Los Angeles or New York City, where you could even further expand your enterprise." Having never thought of such things, the Mexican fisherman asked, "But how long will all this take?" After a rapid mental calculation, the Harvard MBA pronounced, "Probably about 15-20 years, maybe less if you work really hard." "And then what, señor?" asked the fisherman. "Why, that's the best part!" answered the businessman with a laugh. "When the time is right, you would sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions." "Millions? Really? What would I do with it all?" asked the young fisherman in disbelief. The businessman boasted, "Then you could happily retire with all the money you've made. You could move to a quaint coastal fishing village where you could sleep late, play with your grandchildren, watch ball games, and take siesta with your wife. You could stroll to the village in the evenings where you could play the guitar and sing with your friends all you want." 

The moral of the story is: Know what really matters in life, and you may find that it is already much closer than

you think.

All the Difference in The World

Every Sunday morning I take a light jog around a park near my home. There’s a lake located in one corner of

the park. Each time I jog by this lake, I see the same elderly woman sitting at the water’s edge with a small

metal cage sitting beside her.

This past Sunday my curiosity got the best of me, so I stopped jogging and walked over to her. As I got closer,

I realized that the metal cage was in fact a small trap. There were three turtles, unharmed, slowly walking

around the base of the trap. She had a fourth turtle in her lap that she was carefully scrubbing with a spongy

brush.

“Hello,” I said. “I see you here every Sunday morning. If you don’t mind my nosiness, I’d love to know what

you’re doing with these turtles.”

She smiled. “I’m cleaning off their shells,” she replied. “Anything on a turtle’s shell, like algae or scum,

reduces the turtle’s ability to absorb heat and impedes its ability to swim. It can also corrode and weaken the

shell over time.”

“Wow! That’s really nice of you!” I exclaimed.

She went on: “I spend a couple of hours each Sunday morning, relaxing by this lake and helping these little

guys out. It’s my own strange way of making a difference.”

“But don’t most freshwater turtles live their whole lives with algae and scum hanging from their shells?” I asked.

“Yep, sadly, they do,” she replied.

I scratched my head. “Well then, don’t you think your time could be better spent? I mean, I think your efforts

are kind and all, but there are fresh water turtles living in lakes all around the world. And 99% of these turtles

don’t have kind people like you to help them clean off their shells. So, no offense… but how exactly are your

localized efforts here truly making a difference?”

The woman giggled aloud. She then looked down at the turtle in her lap, scrubbed off the last piece of algae

from its shell, and said, “Sweetie, if this little guy could talk, he’d tell you I just made all the difference in the

world.”

The moral: You can change the world – maybe not all at once, but one person, one animal, and one good

deed at a time. Wake up every morning and pretend like what you do makes a difference. It does. (Read 29

Gifts.)

Story #2: The Weight of the Glass

Once upon a time a psychology professor walked around on a stage while teaching stress management

principles to an auditorium filled with students. As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they’d be

asked the typical “glass half empty or glass half full” question. Instead, with a smile on her face, the professor

asked, “How heavy is this glass of water I’m holding?”

Students shouted out answers ranging from eight ounces to a couple pounds.

She replied, “From my perspective, the absolute weight of this glass doesn’t matter. It all depends on how long

I hold it. If I hold it for a minute or two, it’s fairly light. If I hold it for an hour straight, its weight might make my

arm ache a little. If I hold it for a day straight, my arm will likely cramp up and feel completely numb and

paralyzed, forcing me to drop the glass to the floor. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn’t change, but

the longer I hold it, the heavier it feels to me.”

As the class shook their heads in agreement, she continued, “Your stresses and worries in life are very much

like this glass of water. Think about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a bit longer and

you begin to ache a little. Think about them all day long, and you will feel completely numb and paralyzed –

incapable of doing anything else until you drop them.”

The moral: It’s important to remember to let go of your stresses and worries. No matter what happens during

the day, as early in the evening as you can, put all your burdens down. Don’t carry them through the night and

into the next day with you. If you still feel the weight of yesterday’s stress, it’s a strong sign that it’s time to put

the glass down. (Angel and I discuss this process of letting go in the Adversity and Self-Love chapters of

1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.)

Story #3: Shark Bait

During a research experiment a marine biologist placed a shark into a large holding tank and then released

several small bait fish into the tank.

As you would expect, the shark quickly swam around the tank, attacked and ate the smaller fish.

The marine biologist then inserted a strong piece of clear fiberglass into the tank, creating two separate

partitions. She then put the shark on one side of the fiberglass and a new set of bait fish on the other.

Again, the shark quickly attacked. This time, however, the shark slammed into the fiberglass divider and

bounced off. Undeterred, the shark kept repeating this behavior every few minutes to no avail. Meanwhile, the

bait fish swam around unharmed in the second partition. Eventually, about an hour into the experiment, the

shark gave up.

This experiment was repeated several dozen times over the next few weeks. Each time, the shark got less

aggressive and made fewer attempts to attack the bait fish, until eventually the shark got tired of hitting the

fiberglass divider and simply stopped attacking altogether.

The marine biologist then removed the fiberglass divider, but the shark didn’t attack. The shark was trained to

believe a barrier existed between it and the bait fish, so the bait fish swam wherever they wished, free from

harm.

The moral: Many of us, after experiencing setbacks and failures, emotionally give up and stop trying. Like the

shark in the story, we believe that because we were unsuccessful in the past, we will always be unsuccessful.

In other words, we continue to see a barrier in our heads, even when no ‘real’ barrier exists between where we

are and where we want to go. (Read The Road Less Traveled.)

Story #4: Being and Breathing

One warm evening many years ago…

After spending nearly every waking minute with Angel for eight straight days, I knew that I had to tell her just

one thing. So late at night, just before she fell asleep, I whispered it in her ear. She smiled – the kind of smile

that makes me smile back –and she said, “When I’m seventy-five and I think about my life and what it was like

to be young, I hope that I can remember this very moment.”

A few seconds later she closed her eyes and fell asleep. The room was peaceful – almost silent. All I could

hear was the soft purr of her breathing. I stayed awake thinking about the time we’d spent together and all the

choices in our lives that made this moment possible. And at some point, I realized that it didn’t matter what

we’d done or where we’d gone. Nor did the future hold any significance.

All that mattered was the serenity of the moment.

Just being with her and breathing with her.

The moral: We must not allow the clock, the calendar, and external pressures to rule our lives and blind us to

the fact that each individual moment of our lives is a beautiful mystery and a miracle – especially those

moments we spend in the presence of a loved one.

The Bend in the Road

Sometimes we come to life's crossroads

And we view what we think is the end.

But God has a much wider vision

And He knows it's only a bend -

The road will go on and get smoother

And after we've stopped for a rest,

The path that lies hidden beyond us

Is often the path that is best.

So rest and relax and grow stronger,

Let go and let God share your load

And have faith in a brighter tomorrow

You've just come to a bend in the road.

\~ Helen Steiner Rice

Risk

To laugh is to risk appearing a fool,

To weep is to risk appearing sentimental

To reach out to another is to risk involvement,

To expose feelings is to risk exposing your true self

To place your ideas and dreams before a crowd is to risk their loss

To love is to risk not being loved in return,

To hope is to risk despair,

To try is to risk failure

But risks must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing.

The person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing, is nothing.

He may avoid suffering and sorrow,

But he cannot learn, feel, change, grow or live.

Chained by his servitude he is a slave who has forfeited all freedom.

Only a person who risks is free.

The pessimist complains about the wind;

The optimist expects it to change;

And the realist adjusts the sails.

\~William Arthur Ward
