There was a group of four boys, who loved to party. If given the chance they would always party instead of studying because they hated studying so much. The night before a big test, they were out having fun once again and ended up missing the test the next morning. They lied to their teacher that their car had had a flat tire and because they didn’t have a spare tire, they had to push the car back to the house. The teacher listened carefully and told them they could take the exam the next day. Having gotten another chance, the boys studied hard that night. They believed they had fooled their teacher. As they arrived for the test they were asked to sit each in separate classrooms and to their surprise, the 100-question test had only two questions. “Your name?” and “which tire was flat?”
