A few years after I was born, my Dad met a stranger who was new to our small town. From the

beginning, Dad was fascinated with this enchanting newcomer and soon invited him to live with

our family. The stranger was quickly accepted and was around from then on.

As I grew up, I never questioned his place in my in my young mind, he had a special niche. My

parents were complimentary instructors: Mom taught me good from evil, and a Dad taught me to

obey. But the stranger... he was our storyteller. He would keep us spellbound for hours on end

with adventures, mysteries and comedies. If I wanted to know anything about politics, history or

science, he always knew the answers about the past, understood the present and even seemed

able to predict the future! He took my family to the first major league ball game. He made me

laugh, and he made me cry. The stranger never stopped talking, but Dad didn't seem to mind.

Sometimes, Mom would get up quietly while the rest of us were shushing each other to listen to

what he had to say, and she would go to the kitchen for peace and quiet. ( I wonder now if she

ever prayed for the stranger to leave.)

Dad ruled our household with certain moral convictions, but the stranger never felt obligated to

honor them. Profanity, for example, was not allowed in our home - not from us, our friends or

any visitors. Our long time visitor, however, got away with four - letter words that burned my

ears and made my dad squirm and my mother blush.

My dad didn't permit the liberal use of alcohol but the stranger encouraged us to try it on a

regular basis. He made cigarettes look cool, cigars manly, and pipes distinguished. He talked

freely ( much too freely! ) about sex. His comments were sometimes blatant, sometimes

suggestive, and generally embarrassing... I now know that my early concepts about relationships

were influenced strongly by the stranger. Time after time, he opposed the values of my parents,

yet he was seldom rebuked and NEVER asked to leave.

More than 50 years have passed since the stranger moved in with our family. He has blended

right in and is not nearly as fascinating as he was at first. Still, if you could walk into my parents'

den today, you would still find him sitting over in his corner, waiting for someone to listen to

him talk and watch him draw his pictures.

His name?...

We just call him "TV."

He has a wife now... We call her "Computer."

Their first child is "Cell Phone."

Second child "I Pod."

And JUST BORN THIS YEAR was a grandchild " IPAD.
