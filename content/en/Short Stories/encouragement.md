The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake. Ducks and swans played on the water while

children sailed their model boats. Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every

color and a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance. As the man by the

window described all this in exquisite detail, the man on the other side of the room would

close his eyes and imagine the picturesque scene.

One warm afternoon the man by the window described a parade passing by. Although the

other man couldn’t hear the band – he could see it in his mind’s eye as the gentleman by the

window portrayed it with descriptive words.

Days and weeks passed.

One morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths, only to find the lifeless

body of the man by the window, who had died peacefully in his sleep. She was saddened and

called the hospital attendants to take the body away. As soon as it seemed appropriate, the

other man asked if he could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the

switch, and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone.

Slowly, painfully, he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the real world

outside. He strained to slowly turn to look out the window beside the bed. It faced a blank

wall. The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his deceased roommate who had

described such wonderful things outside this window. The nurse responded that the man was

blind and could not even see the wall.

She said, “Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you.”
