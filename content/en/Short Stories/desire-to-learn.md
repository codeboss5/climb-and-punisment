I was out at the hobby store looking for some new enhancements for my remote helicopter and as I was leaving the store right next to it was one of those learning stores. The kind that sell educational supplies and games. I am constantly amazed at the items that are available for kids these days so I stopped in to satisfy my own curiosity. While looking around I noticed signs that stated discounts to teachers. I remembered a story on the news about some teachers using their own money to buy supplies so I posed as a new teacher so green that I didn't know anything about processes. At the check-out the manager told me how many teachers come in and purchase supplies the school can't or won't buy for the class. That is so wrong. We spoke for a while and as luck would have it a teacher came up to check out and I stepped aside. It seems many are regulars and the manager know the story about most of them. That was all I needed to know. I was put in touch with this manager for a reason. After the teacher left I explained to the manager that I wanted to help. Did they have any gift certificates I could purchase? They did and I bought some. I handed them back to the manager and explained God wanted her to give them to the most needy teachers. Just as I started to leave and the manager asked me for my name, I turned and winked and said it was not from me and my name is not important. I know some kids will be able to do better this coming year and that makes me smile.
