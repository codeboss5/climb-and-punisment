After a few of the usual Sunday evening hymns, the church's Pastor slowly stood up, walked over to the pulpit

and, before he gave his sermon for the evening, briefly introduced a guest Minister who was in the service that

evening. In the introduction, the Pastor told the congregation that the guest Minister was one of his dearest

childhood friends and that he wanted him to have a few moments to greet the church and share whatever he felt

would be appropriate for the service. With that, the elderly gentleman stepped up to the pulpit and began to

speak.

"A father, and his son, and a friend of his son were sailing off the Pacific coast," he began... "when a fast storm

blocked any attempt to get back to the shore. The waves were so high, even though the father was an

experienced sailor, he could not keep the boat upright and the three were swept into the ocean as the boat

capsized."

The old man hesitated for a moment, making eye contact with two teenagers who were, for the first time since

the service began, looking somewhat interested in his story. The aged minister continued with his story...

"Grabbing a rescue line, the father had to make the most excruciating decision of his life: to which boy would

he throw the end of the life line? He had only seconds to make the decision. The father knew that his son was a

Christian and he also knew that his son's friend was not. The agony of his decision could not be matched by the

torrent of waves.

As the father yelled out 'I Love You, Son!' he threw out the life line to his son's friend. By the time the father

had pulled the friend back to the capsized boat his son had disappeared beneath the raging swells into the black

night. His body was never recovered," the old man said sadly.

By this time, the two teenagers were sitting up straight in the pew, anxiously waiting for the next words to come

out of the old Minister's mouth.

"The father," he continued, "knew his son would step into eternity with Jesus and he could not bear the thought

of his son's friend stepping into an eternity without Jesus. Therefore, he sacrificed his son to save the son's

friend. How great is the love of God that he should do the same for us? Our Heavenly Father sacrificed His only

begotten Son so that we could be saved. I urge you to accept His offer to rescue you and take hold of the life

line He is throwing out to you in this service."

With that, the old man turned and sat back down in his chair as silence filled the room. The Pastor again walked

slowly to the pulpit and delivered a brief sermon with an invitation at the end. However, no one responded to

the appeal. But, within moments after the service ended, the two boys were at the old man's side.

"That was a nice story," politely stated one of the boys, "but I don't think it was very realistic for a father to give

up his only son's life in hopes that the other would become a Christian."

"Well, you've got a point there," the old man replied, glancing down at his worn Bible. As a big smile

broadened his narrow face, he looked up again at the boys and said, "It sure isn't very realistic, is it? But I'm

here today to tell you this story gives me a glimpse of what it must have been like for God to give up His only

Son for me. You see...I was that father, and your Pastor is my son's friend."
