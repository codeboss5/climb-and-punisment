I'd just like to share this story I have just read with you:

"Hi Mum, what are you doing?", asked Susie. "I'm making a casserole for Mrs Smith next door," said her

mother.

"Why?" asked Susie, who was only six years old. "Because Mrs Smith is very sad; she lost her daughter and she

has a broken heart. We need to take care of her for a little while."

"Why, Mum?"

"You see, Susie, when someone is very, very said, they have trouble doing the little things like making dinner

or other chores. Because we're part of a community and Mrs Smith is our neighbour we need to do

some things to help her. Mrs Smith won't ever be able to talk with her daughter or hug her do all those

wonderful things that mum and daughters do together. You are a very smart gir, Susie; maybe you'll think of

some way to help take care of Mrs Smith."

Susie noticed that Mrs Smith didn't have that familiar musical quality about her voice when she greeted

someone. Mrs Smith also looked as though she might have been crying because her eyes were watery and

swollen.

"What can I do for you Susie?", asked Mrs Smith.

"My mum says that you lost your daughter and you're very, very said with a broken yeart, "Susie held her

hand out shyly. In it was a Band-Aid. "This is for your broken heart," Mrs Smith gasped, choking back her

tears. She knelt down and hugged Susie. Through her tears she said, "Thank you, darling girl, this will help a

lot."

Mrs Smith accepted Susie'a act of kindness and took it one step further. She purchased a small key ring with a

plexiglass picture frame - the ones designed to carry keys and proudly display a family portrait at the same

time. Mrs Smith placed Susie's Band-Aid in the frame to remind herself to heal a little every time she sees

it. She wisely knows that healing takes time and support. It has become her symbol for healing, while not

forgetting the joy and love she experienced with her daughter.
